This extension is needed because `category` has a cardinality of 0..1  and the zib profile uses `category` with a fixed code, thereby denying the use of `category` for other purposes. A future version of FHIR will relax the cardinality to 0...* and the binding strength to _example_.","copyright":"Copyright and related rights waived via CC0, https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/.
