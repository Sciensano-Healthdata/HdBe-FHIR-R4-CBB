This is a common occurence when the FHIR element has datatype _code_ and has a _required_ binding with an incompatible FHIR core ValueSet. It can also happen when the FHIR element has a _string_ or other non-coded datatype.\r\n\r\nIn this case, the FHIR element may be augmented with this extension to communicate the code from the functional description. This information should always be _added_ to the normal use of the FHIR element to allow for maximum interoperability.","copyright":"Copyright and related rights waived via CC0, https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/.
