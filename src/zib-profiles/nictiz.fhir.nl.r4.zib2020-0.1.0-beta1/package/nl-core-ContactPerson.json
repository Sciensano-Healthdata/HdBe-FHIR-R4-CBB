A Dutch name still is a proper FHIR _HumanName_, which means that systems that cannot interpret the extensions will still be able to render and work with this datatype.\r\n\r\nTo have true compatibility an implementer SHOULD use the core _HumanName_ parts as intended. To have names work for Dutch context, the implementer SHOULD in addition use the extension elements. Furthermore, it is encouraged to provide a representation of the full name in the `HumanName.text` element.\r\n\r\n**Separate name parts**\r\n\r\nThe first addition is that Dutch names make certain name parts separately communicable. These parts are required for use in true Dutch systems when dealing with Dutch names, but may not have value for international systems when information gets sent abroad.\r\n\r\nThe extension elements cover birth name (NL: achternaam) and partner/spouse name. Both may have a prefix (NL: voorvoegsel). When a person marries, he or she may keep their own name, assume the partner name, append the partner name to their own name, or the other way around. For this reason, there are extensions for marking each part for what it is.\r\n\r\nExample: miss Irma Jongeneel marries mister de Haas and assumes the name Irma Jongeneel-de Haas.\r\n\r\n* `family` = \"Jongeneel-de Haas\"\r\n* `given` = \"Irma\"\r\n* `family.extension:lastName` = \"Jongeneel\"\r\n* `family.extension:partnerPrefix` = \"de \"\r\n* `family.extension:partnerLastName` = \"Haas\"\r\n\r\n**The `HumanName.use` element**\r\n\r\nThe use of element `HumanName.use` is discouraged because the zib model does not contain a corresponding concept. If `.use` is populated, its value SHALL match the semantics of the other elements. To illustrate: if `.use` is set to _official_, it is not expected that the zib concept 'GivenName' (NL: roepnaam) is populated because this is not part of an official name.\r\n\r\nIf the `.use` element is populated, it is likely that a full name can only be communicated using multiple instances of this profile, one for each purpose of `.use`. Receiving systems SHOULD be able to handle multiple instances of this datatype profile in an instance.\r\n\r\n**The zib concept 'titles'**\r\n\r\nThe zib concept 'titles' for noble and scientific titles cannot be fully mapped to FHIR. Sending systems should make an effort to provide title information in the best way possible using the `.prefix` and `.suffix` elements conform the definition of FHIR. However, if it is not possible to break down the titles properly, it can be communicated as-is using the `.prefix` element . Receiving systems should be resilient for a broader range of information in the `.prefix` element than stated by its definition. See the guidance on the `.prefix` and `.suffix` elements for more information.","requirements":"Related persons need to be identified by name, but it is uncommon to need details about multiple other names for that person.","alias":["Naamgegevens","nl-core-NameInformation"],"min":0,"max":"*","base":{"path":"RelatedPerson.name","min":0,"max":"*"},"type":[{"code":"HumanName","profile":["http://nictiz.nl/fhir/StructureDefinition/nl-core-NameInformation"]}],"example":[{"label":"Structured HumanName (preferred above unstructured)","valueHumanName":{"extension":[{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/humanname-assembly-order","valueCode":"NL4"}],"text":"Irma Jongeneel-de Haas","family":"Jongeneel-de Haas","_family":{"extension":[{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/humanname-own-name","valueString":"Jongeneel"},{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/humanname-partner-prefix","valueString":"de"},{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/humanname-partner-name","valueString":"Haas"}]},"given":["Irma","I."],"_given":[{"extension":[{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/iso21090-EN-qualifier","valueCode":"CL"}]},{"extension":[{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/iso21090-EN-qualifier","valueCode":"IN"}]}]}},{"label":"Unstructured HumanName","valueHumanName":{"text":"Irma Jongeneel-de Haas"}}],"condition":["ele-1"],"constraint":[{"key":"ele-1","severity":"error","human":"All FHIR elements must have a @value or children","expression":"hasValue() or (children().count() > id.count())","xpath":"@value|f:*|h:div","source":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Element"},{"key":"zib-NameInformation-1","severity":"error","human":"If a prefix for a familiy name is specified, the family name is expected as well","expression":"name.family.extension('http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/humanname-own-prefix').empty().not() implies name.family.extension('http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/humanname-own-name').empty().not()","source":"http://nictiz.nl/fhir/StructureDefinition/zib-NameInformation"},{"key":"zib-NameInformation-2","severity":"error","human":"If the prefix for a partner family name is specified, the partner family name is expected as well","expression":"name.family.extension('http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/humanname-partner-prefix').empty().not() implies name.family.extension('http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/humanname-partner-name').empty().not()","source":"http://nictiz.nl/fhir/StructureDefinition/zib-NameInformation"},{"key":"zib-NameInformation-3","severity":"warning","human":"If the name is specified as 'official' then the name is expected to contain only official parts","expression":"use.where(value = 'official').exists() implies given.extension('http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/iso21090-EN-qualifier').where(value = 'CL').exists().not()","source":"http://nictiz.nl/fhir/StructureDefinition/zib-NameInformation"}],"isSummary":true,"mapping":[{"identity":"rim","map":"n/a"},{"identity":"v2","map":"XPN"},{"identity":"rim","map":"EN (actually, PN)"},{"identity":"servd","map":"ProviderName"},{"identity":"v2","map":"NK1-2"},{"identity":"rim","map":"name"},{"identity":"zib-nameinformation-v1.1-2020EN","map":"NL-CM:20.4.1","comment":"NameInformation"},{"identity":"zib-contactperson-v3.4-2020EN","map":"NL-CM:3.1.4","comment":"NameInformation"}]},{"id":"RelatedPerson.telecom","extension":[{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/structuredefinition-standards-status","valueCode":"normative"},{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/structuredefinition-normative-version","valueCode":"4.0.0"}],"path":"RelatedPerson.telecom","slicing":{"discriminator":[{"type":"profile","path":"$this"}],"rules":"open"},"short":"ContactInformation","definition":"The contact’s telephone number and/or e-mail address.","comment":"The cardinality mismatch between the zib (0..1) and FHIR (0..*) is explained by the containers TelephoneNumbers (0..*) and EmailAddresses (0..*) inside the ContactInformation model.

A Dutch Address still is a proper FHIR Address, which means that systems that cannot interpret the extensions will still be able to render and work with this datatype.\r\n\r\nTo have true compatibility an implementer SHOULD use the core Address parts as intended. To have addresses work for Dutch context, the implementer SHOULD in addition use the extension elements.\r\n\r\n**Separate address parts**\r\n\r\nThe first addition is that Dutch addresses make certain address parts separately communicable. These parts are required for use in true Dutch systems when dealing with Dutch addresses, but may not have value for international systems when information gets sent abroad.\r\n\r\n**Custom address types**\r\n\r\nThe second addition is that the zib defines its own ValueSet for address types, which can only be partially expressed using the FHIR Address datatype and requires a mapping to multiple elements. The table below explains how the zib concepts are mapped to the various FHIR elements (see the ConceptMaps <http://nictiz.nl/fhir/ConceptMap/AdresSoortCodelijst-to-AddressUse> and <http://nictiz.nl/fhir/ConceptMap/AdresSoortCodelijst-to-AddressType> as well).
