A Dutch Address still is a proper FHIR Address, which means that systems that cannot interpret the extensions will still be able to render and work with this datatype.\r\n\r\nTo have true compatibility an implementer SHOULD use the core Address parts as intended. To have addresses work for Dutch context, the implementer SHOULD in addition use the extension elements.\r\n\r\n**Separate address parts**\r\n\r\nThe first addition is that Dutch addresses make certain address parts separately communicable. These parts are required for use in true Dutch systems when dealing with Dutch addresses, but may not have value for international systems when information gets sent abroad.\r\n\r\n**Custom address types**\r\n\r\nThe second addition is that the zib defines its own ValueSet for address types, which can only be partially expressed using the FHIR Address datatype and requires a mapping to multiple elements. The table below explains how the zib concepts are mapped to the various FHIR elements (see the ConceptMaps <http://nictiz.nl/fhir/ConceptMap/AdresSoortCodelijst-to-AddressUse> and <http://nictiz.nl/fhir/ConceptMap/AdresSoortCodelijst-to-AddressType> as well). The code from the zib should also be included using the extension on `Address.extension:addressType`.\r\n\r\n         | zib                               | .ext:addressType | .use | .type    |\r\n         |-----------------------------------|------------------|------|----------|\r\n         | Postal Address/Postadres          | PST              |      | postal   |\r\n         | Primary Home/Officieel adres      | HP               | home | both     |\r\n         | Visit Address/Woon-/verblijfadres | PHYS             | home | physical |\r\n         | Temporary Address/Tijdelijk adres | TMP              | temp |          |\r\n         | Work Place/Werkadres              | WP               | work |          |\r\n         | Vacation Home/Vakantie adres      | HV               | temp |          |\r\n\r\nIf `Address.type` is _both_ then this is to be understood as a dual purpose address (postal and physical), unless a specific \"postal\" type address is added. Systems that support importing it like this are encouraged to do so, otherwise they may need to import this as two separate addresses.\r\n\r\nNote: FHIR core defines the AD-use extension to further specify the postal address type. However, the ValueSet used in that extension doesn't completely match the zib ValueSet. Therefore, a custom extension has been made. This doesn't preclude the use of the AD-use extension.","comment":"Note: address is intended to describe postal addresses for administrative purposes, not to describe absolute geographical coordinates.
