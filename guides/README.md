# HdBe-FHIR-R4-CBB/guides
This folder contains all required files for implementation guides that are hosted on Simplifier.net. Every folder represents a specific implementation guide. The implementation guide is managed through GitHub, not on Simplifier. Any update within Simplifier is not synced with this folder. More information can be found in the [Simplifier docs about managing IGs using GitHub](https://docs.fire.ly/projects/Simplifier/simplifierIGeditor.html#manage-your-ig-using-github).
