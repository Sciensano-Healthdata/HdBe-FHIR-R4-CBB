    Consent.scope*:
      - message: Unknown Code http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/consentscope#adr in http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/consentscope for 'http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/consentscope#adr'
        reason: This concerns an error in the FHIR terminology server. The adr code has been removed for R5 and the terminology server was updated for it too soon. They will fix it according to this zulip chat "https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/179166-implementers/topic/Consent.2Escope.3A.20diff.20in.20codes.20shown.20on.20FHIR.20vs.20Tx.20server"
      - message: None of the codings provided are in the value set 'Consent Scope Codes' (http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/consent-scope), and a coding should come from this value set unless it has no suitable code
        reason: see above

      - message: None of the codings provided are in the value set 'CausativeAgent' (https://fhir.healthdata.be/ValueSet/CausativeAgent), and a coding from this value set is required) (codes = http://snomed.info/sct#419442005)
        reason: The CausativeAgent ValueSet contains a filter on a SCT ^751000172100| Belgian subset for POC FHIR, causative agent, no drug (foundation metadata concept). This is not a snomed hierarchy but a refset. The ValueSet filterering should be okay according to https://www.hl7.org/fhir/snomedct.html#4.3.1.0.8.2. Therefore we assume that the JAVA validator/terminology server does not support this, or has no access to the BE refset.
