## zib-TreatmentDirective2 difference

| Concept         | Category          | Description                             | 
|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------|
|`provision.code` | terminology | Changed binding strenght from Required to Extensible because it is very likely other codes may be relevant in the future. This is already the case with the zibs in release 2020 versus the pre-release of 2022 where new codes have been added. |
|`provision.type` | terminology | Changed ValueSet and related ConceptMap to have SNOMED codes instead of zib internal codes.  |
|`policy.uri` | textual | Replaced Dutch context in the guidance on how to populate the policy. Instead of a suggestion for wetten.overheid.nl the URL https://www.belgielex.be/ is now given.
