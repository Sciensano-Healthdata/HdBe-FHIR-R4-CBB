# HdBe-FHIR-R4-CBB/resources
This folder contains FHIR conformance resources (StructureDefinition, a.k.a profiles and extensions). Filenames follow the profiling guidelines.

Every CBB profile will have an accompanying documentation file that contains the differential with the zib-profile by Nictiz. The documentation file has the same name as the CBB-profile and ends with `.doc.md`. For example `HdBe-Patient.xml` <-> `HdBe-Patient.doc.md`.
