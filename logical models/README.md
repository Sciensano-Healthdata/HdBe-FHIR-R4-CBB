# HdBe-FHIR-R4-CBB/logical models
This folder contains FHIR Logical Models (StructureDefinition, kind = "logical") that represent the Clinical Buideling Blocks by Healthdata.be. Filenames follow the profiling guidelines.

Every CBB logical model will have an accompanying documentation file that contains the differential with the zib. The documentation file has the same name as the CBB-profile and ends with `.doc.md`. For example `HdBe-Patient.xml` <-> `HdBe-Patient.doc.md`.
