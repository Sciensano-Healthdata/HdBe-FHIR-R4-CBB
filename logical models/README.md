# HdBe-FHIR-R4-CBB/logical models
This folder contains FHIR Logical Models (StructureDefinition, kind = "logical") that represent the Clinical Building Blocks by Healthdata.be. Filenames follow the profiling guidelines.

Every CBB logical model will have an accompanying documentation file that contains a changelog/differential to the zib. The documentation file has the same name as the CBB-profile and ends with `.doc.md`. For example `HdBe-Patient.xml` <-> `HdBe-Patient.doc.md`.
