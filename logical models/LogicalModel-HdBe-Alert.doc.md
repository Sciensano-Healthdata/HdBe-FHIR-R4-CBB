|`alert_name` | textual | Removed the notion of allowing free text in the definition because this is confusing and we want to stimulate the use of codes. The ValueSet binding is extensible, meaning that other codes or a text as fall back can be used. 
|`alert_name` | terminology | Replaced NullFlavor Other and Unkown with SNOMED equivelant codes.
