## zib [LaboratoryTestResult-v4.6](https://zibs.nl/wiki/LaboratoryTestResult-v4.6(2020EN)) difference

| Concept         | Category          | Description                             | 
|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------|
|`LaboratoryTest.TestCode` | terminology | Removed ValueSet binding and described in the comment the use of Loinc and Albert codes as per the subset defined by the FPS Health (ReTaM). Added a reference to the subset on the website of the FPS Health. The ReTaM codes are not duplicated in a FHIR ValueSet because this would require extensive maintenance in keeping the ValueSet up-to-date. |
|`LaboratoryTest.TestResult`| type | The zib datatype 'ANY' was incorrectly exported as only a 'string', likely because Forge was giving an (incorrect) warning. The element has been made polymorphic by allowing all the `Observation.Value[x]` datatype options. | 
|`LaboratoryTest.TestResult`| textual | Added textual guidance to include the unit for quantitative results. | 
|`LaboratoryTest.TestResultStatus` | terminology | Replaced the values of the ValueSet TestResultStatus with corresponding values from the Observation-status valueset from FHIR. |
|`LaboratoryTest.TestResultStatus` | textual | Changed 'an panel/cluster' to 'a panel/cluster'. ([zib ticket #1551](https://bits.nictiz.nl/browse/ZIB-1551))|
|`LaboratoryTest.ResultFlags` | textual | Removed notion of 'Resistent', 'Intermediate' and 'Susceptible' codes in definition.
|`LaboratoryTest.ReferenceRangeUpperLimit`| type | The concepts ReferenceRangeUpperLimit and ReferenceRangeLowerLimit are defined as datatype ANY, but it is unclear how these concepts should work for anything that is not a Quantity or string. In addition, there's no obvious way in FHIR to support reference values other than type Quantity or string. Therefore, support for reference ranges has been restricted to Quantity and String. ([zib ticket #1703](https://bits.nictiz.nl/browse/ZIB-1703)) | 
|`LaboratoryTest.ReferenceRangeLowerLimit`| type | The concepts ReferenceRangeUpperLimit and ReferenceRangeLowerLimit are defined as datatype ANY, but it is unclear how these concepts should work for anything that is not a Quantity or string. In addition, there's no obvious way in FHIR to support reference values other than type Quantity or string. Therefore, support for reference ranges has been restricted to Quantity and String. ([zib ticket #1703](https://bits.nictiz.nl/browse/ZIB-1703)).  | 
|`LaboratoryTest.ResultFlags` | terminology | Removed concepts 'Resistant', 'Intermediate' and 'Susceptible' from the ValueSet. These codes are seen as a quantitative result. ([zib ticket #1555](https://bits.nictiz.nl/browse/ZIB-1555))
|`LaboratoryTest.InterpretationMethod`| terminology | Removed bound ValuSet because it is invalid. ([zib ticket #1292](https://bits.nictiz.nl/browse/ZIB-1292)) and ([zib ticket #677](https://bits.nictiz.nl/browse/ZIB-677))
|`Specimen.ContainerType`| terminology | Relaxed binding from required to preferred. ([zib ticket #1552](https://bits.nictiz.nl/browse/ZIB-1552))|
|`Specimen.SpecimenMaterial`| terminology | Replaced SpecimenMaterial valueset values from a SNOMED descendent-of 105590001 (Substance) to a descendent-of 123038009 (Specimen) because this makes it simpler, it is already in use in the DCD's like this and the container element can be used when additional information is required. ([zib ticket #1554](https://bits.nictiz.nl/browse/ZIB-1554)) |
|`Specimen.AnatomicalLocation`| textual | Changed anatomic to anatomical in the definition. ([zib ticket #1551](https://bits.nictiz.nl/browse/ZIB-1551))| 
|`Specimen.Microorganism` | terminology | Replaced Dutch reference set for Microorganism by changing the SNOMED hierarchy 2581000146104 (Dutch microorganism simple reference set) to 410607006 (Organism). |
|`Specimen.ReceivedDateTime`| textual | Removed sentence 'This is the issue...' ([zib ticket #1551](https://bits.nictiz.nl/browse/ZIB-1551))|
|`Specimen.SpecimenSource` | type | Changed datatype from string to CodeableConcept and added ValueSet SpecimenSource with an extensible binding. |
|`Specimen.SpecimenSource` | terminology | Constructed ValueSet SpecimenSource and added it with an extensible binding ([zib ticket #1845](https://bits.nictiz.nl/browse/ZIB-1845)). |
|`PanelOrBattery` | terminology | Removed ValueSet binding and described in the comment the use of Loinc and Albert codes as per the subset defined by the FPS Health (ReTaM). Added a reference to the subset on the website of the FPS Health. The ReTaM codes are not duplicated in a FHIR ValueSet because this would require extensive maintenance in keeping the ValueSet up-to-date. |
|`ResultStatus`| terminology | Replaced zib CodeSystem values to corresponding values from the FHIR ObservationStatus CodeSystem because these are more widely adopted and can be mapped to zib status terminology. The new ValueSet contains a subset of the ObservationStatus CodeSystem to maintain compatibility with the zib. Also merged duplicated status ValueSets into one 'TestResultStatus' ValueSet because a ValueSet with similar codes was bound to `.TestResultStatus`.  |
|`Recorder`| element | Added element Recorder with a reference to HealthProfessional to assign a person responsible for the LaboratoryTestResult. |
