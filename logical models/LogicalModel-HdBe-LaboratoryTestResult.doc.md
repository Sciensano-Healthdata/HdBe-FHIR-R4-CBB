## zib [LaboratoryTestResult-v4.6](https://zibs.nl/wiki/LaboratoryTestResult-v4.6(2020EN)) difference

| Concept         | Category          | Description                             | 
|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------|
|`specimen.container_type`| terminology | Relaxed binding from required to preferred. ([zib ticket #1552](https://bits.nictiz.nl/browse/ZIB-1552))|
|`specimen.specimen_material`| terminology | Replaced SpecimenMaterial valueset values from a SNOMED descendent-of 105590001 (Substance) to a descendent-of 123038009 (Specimen) because this makes it simpler, it is already in use in the DCD's like this and the container element can be used when additional information is required. ([zib ticket #1554](https://bits.nictiz.nl/browse/ZIB-1554)) |
|`specimen.anatomical_location`| textual | Changed anatomic to anatomical in the definition. ([zib ticket #1551](https://bits.nictiz.nl/browse/ZIB-1551))| 
|`specimen.microorganism` | terminology | Replaced Dutch reference set for Microorganism by changing the SNOMED hierarchy 2581000146104 (Dutch microorganism simple reference set) to 410607006 (Organism). |
|`specimen.received_date_time`| textual | Removed sentence 'This is the issue...' ([zib ticket #1551](https://bits.nictiz.nl/browse/ZIB-1551))|
|`laboratory_test.test_code` | terminology | Removed ValueSet binding and described in the comment the use of Loinc and Albert codes as per the subset defined by the FPS Health (ReTaM). Added a reference to the subset on the website of the FPS Health. The ReTaM codes are not duplicated in a FHIR ValueSet because this would require extensive maintenance in keeping the ValueSet up-to-date. |
|`laboratory_test.test_result`| type | The zib datatype 'ANY' was incorrectly exported as only a 'string', likely because Forge was giving an (incorrect) warning. The element has been made polymorphic by allowing all the `Observation.value[x]` datatype options. | 
|`laboratory_test.test_result`| textual | Added textual guidance to include the unit for quantitative results. | 
|`laboratory_test.test_result_status` | terminology | Replaced the values of the ValueSet TestResultStatus with corresponding values from the Observation-status valueset from FHIR. |
|`laboratory_test.test_result_status` | textual | Changed 'an panel/cluster' to 'a panel/cluster'. ([zib ticket #1551](https://bits.nictiz.nl/browse/ZIB-1551))|
|`laboratory_test.interpretation_method`| terminology | Removed bound ValuSet because it is invalid. ([zib ticket #1292](https://bits.nictiz.nl/browse/ZIB-1292)) and ([zib ticket #677](https://bits.nictiz.nl/browse/ZIB-677))
|`laboratory_test.result_flags` | terminology | Removed concepts 'Resistent', 'Intermediate' and 'Susceptible' from the ValueSet. These codes are seen as a quantitative result. ([zib ticket #1555](https://bits.nictiz.nl/browse/ZIB-1555))
|`laboratory_test.result_flags` | textual | Removed notion of 'Resistent', 'Intermediate' and 'Susceptible' codes in definition.
|`laboratory_test.reference_range_upper_limit`| type | The concepts ReferenceRangeUpperLimit and ReferenceRangeLowerLimit are defined as datatype ANY, but it is unclear how these concepts should work for anything that is not a Quantity or string. In addition, there's no obvious way in FHIR to support reference values other than of type Quantity or string. Therefore, support for reference ranges has been restricten to Quantity and String. ([zib ticket #1703](https://bits.nictiz.nl/browse/ZIB-1703)) | 
|`laboratory_test.reference_range_lower_limit`| type | The concepts ReferenceRangeUpperLimit and ReferenceRangeLowerLimit are defined as datatype ANY, but it is unclear how these concepts should work for anything that is not a Quantity or string. In addition, there's no obvious way in FHIR to support reference values other than of type Quantity or string. Therefore, support for reference ranges has been restricten to Quantity and String. ([zib ticket #1703](https://bits.nictiz.nl/browse/ZIB-1703)).  | 
|`result_status`| terminology | Deduplicated ValueSet by replacing ValueSet from ResultStatus to TestResultStatus which is bound on `.test_result_status` too. Also replaced the values with corresponding values from the Observation-status valueset from FHIR. |
